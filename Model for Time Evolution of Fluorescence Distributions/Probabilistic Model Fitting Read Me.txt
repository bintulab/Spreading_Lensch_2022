Raw data exists as .csv files named for CR+Spacer/Geometry+Rep/Clone (K562 reps are distinguished by an "R" before the rep number). 
All data is to 5 days, except where the name ends in an "A" for All where data goes to 24 days (only for K562 HDAC NS and 5kb).
	examples:	KNS8 is CHO KRAB No Spacer clone 8 
	    		KNSR2 is K562 KRAB No Spacer rep 2
	Note that CHO ins data is multiclonal and reps are numbered 1-3 (no R), but CHO HSH also has 3 single clones (not numbered 1-3).

In each .csv file, there are 3 columns for the following fields:
	[log10(Cit_Fluorescence), log10(mCh_Fluorescence), Day]
	Data was gated for live cells and IFP pos using EasyflowCyto.m before writing to .csv format.
	-dox days are negative integers

Fits are conducted in "Probabilistic Model Fitting..." files. All fits include mRNA and spike delay, but HDAC fits have an unfixed
gamma while KRAB fits use gamma values from HDAC fits, or estimated gamma values from raw HDAC data. The code for each core file
is identical, but the fits are distributed among the core files to allow parallel processing.

The best fit parameters are saved as .pkl files, which can be opened in Python. The file contains a tuple. The first value (index 
0) of the tuple is a dictionary for the Citrine fits. The keys are named for the .csv files that generated the fit.
	example:	# The following lines of code return the best fit parameters for K562 HDAC 5kb Cit Rep 2
			import pickle
			data = pickle.load(open('K562_H5K_Final_Fits.pkl', 'rb'))
			data[0]['H5KR2A']

The returned parameters are listed in the following order:
	[alpha, beta, gamma, sigma, k, mu, P_b, F_b, sd]

Violin plots and parameter plots are generated in their corresponding Jupyter notebooks and saved as both .png and .eps or .svg files.
